# VM vs. Container: Quick Comparison

| Feature                | Virtual Machines (VMs)                          | Containers (OCI)                                    |
|------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| **Technology**         | Hypervisor-based virtualization (e.g., VMware)  | OS-level virtualization (Docker, Podman, etc.)      |
| **Startup Time**       | Minutes                                          | Seconds                                              |
| **Performance**        | Slightly lower due to full OS overhead          | Near-native, lightweight                             |
| **Resource Footprint** | Large (full OS per VM)                          | Small (shared host OS kernel)                        |
| **Isolation Level**    | Strong (full OS and kernel per VM)              | Moderate (process-level, shared kernel)              |
| **Portability**        | Good (via VM images)                            | Excellent (image layers, container registries)       |
| **Use Case**           | Legacy apps, full OS needs, strong isolation    | Microservices, CI/CD, cloud-native apps             |
| **Security**           | Stronger due to full OS isolation               | Depends on configuration (namespaces, cgroups, etc.) |
| **Management Overhead**| High (full OS updates, patching, etc.)         | Low (single host OS to manage)                      |
| **Typical Size**       | GBs (OS + app)                                  | MBs (app + minimal base image)                      |
